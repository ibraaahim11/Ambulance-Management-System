<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## <a id="about-the-project"></a>üöë About The Project

This project simulates the operations of an Ambulance Management System that manages patient requests and car assignments across multiple hospitals. Developed as part of the Data Structures and Algorithms course, it focuses on efficient use of queues, priority queues, and file handling to reflect real-time emergency service behavior.

The system handles Emergency (EP), Special (SP), and Normal (NP) patient requests, assigns cars (with or without special facilities), simulates the process over time steps, and calculates performance statistics.

It is also an exercise in applying data structures to model real-world scenarios, allowing complex hospital operations to be simulated in milliseconds. The system can log into any hospital setup and instantly calculate metrics such as average wait time, car utilization, and failed assignments, making it possible to test multiple operational scenarios and evaluate hospital performance under different conditions.

## <a id="project-details"></a>üìÑ Project Details

## üë®‚Äç‚öïÔ∏è Key Features
- **Time-step based simulation engine** for real-time event modeling.  
- **Handles 3 patient types**: Emergency (EP), Special (SP), and Normal (NP).  
- **Custom-built Priority Queues** (for EP & SP) and **Custom-built FCFS Queues** (for NP) ‚Äî implemented **from scratch without STL**.  
- **Dynamic car assignment** based on patient priority and available car type (special or normal).  
- **NP request cancellations** handled through input files.  
- **EP rerouting** to the nearest hospital when the target hospital is at capacity.  
- **Performance tracking**: car busy time, patient wait time, service completion rates.  
- **Two simulation modes**: Interactive (step-by-step view) & Silent (only logs output).  
- **Extensive file I/O** for reading simulation scenarios and logging outputs.  
- **Scalable design**: can easily simulate different numbers of hospitals, cars, and patients.  


### üßÆ Data Structures Used

- **Priority Queue**: For emergency patients (EP)
- **Queue (FCFS)**: For special (SP) and normal (NP) patients
- **Graph (Distance Matrix)**: Represents hospital distances
- **File I/O**: For reading inputs and writing outputs
- **Linked Lists / Arrays**: For tracking cars, patients, and hospital data

## <a id="file-structure"></a>üìÇ File Structure

- A folder named **`Input and Output Files`** is included in the project.
- It contains multiple example input files along with their corresponding output files.
- You can use these to explore how different input scenarios affect the simulation results.
- To test your own input, place your file in the **project directory** and name it **`sample_input.txt`** before running the simulation.

---

## <a id="sample-input-file-structure"></a>üìÑ Sample Input File Structure

When adding your own input file (**`sample_input.txt`**) to the project directory, follow this exact structure so the simulation can read it correctly:

![Sample Input Structure](./documents/read-me-pictures/sample-input-structure.png)

‚ö† **Important:**  
- Ensure there are no extra blank lines between sections.  
- Patient requests appear before cancellations in the file.
- The order of these sections must be preserved for correct simulation.
